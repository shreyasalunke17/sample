/*
i)Usage of clone() method-Shallow Copy
Note â€“ In the below code example the clone() method does create a completely new object with a different hashCode value,
which means its in a separate memory location. But due to the Test object c being inside Test2, the primitive types have
achieved deep copy but this Test object c is still shared between t1 and t2. To overcome that we explicitly do a deep copy
for object variable c, which is discussed later.
