/*
ii)Usage of clone() method â€“ Deep Copy
If we want to create a deep copy of object X and place it in a new object Y then a new copy of any referenced objects fields
are created and these references are placed in object Y. This means any changes made in referenced object fields in object
X or Y will be reflected only in that object and not in the other. In the below example, we create a deep copy of the object.
A deep copy copies all fields and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields.
A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.
