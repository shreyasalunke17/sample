/*
Increment operator (++):
the increment operator is an operator which is used to increase the value of a variable by 1, on which it is applied.

Again these increment operators are two types:
Pre increment (++x)
Post increment (x++)

Pre Increment Operator:
If an Increment operator is used in front of an operand, then it is called  as Pre Increment operator.

Syntax: ++operand;

Pre increment operator is applied  on x operand, here first the value of x will be incremented by 1 and
then the incremented value will be assigned to the variable y.
As per example,the initial value of ‘x’ is 10. After applying pre-increment operator on ‘x’ the value of ‘x’ is incremented by 1
(i.e.11) and that value is assigned to the variable ‘y’. So that the final value of ‘y’ is 11.
