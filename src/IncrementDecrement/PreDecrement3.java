/* Pre-Decrement Operator (--x)
If the decrement operator (--) is mentioned before the variable like a prefix (--x),then it is called a pre-decrement operator.
The value of the variable is first decremented by 1,and then other computations are performed. */
















/* Syntax
The syntax for decrement operator is a pair of negative signs ie;
--x;
x--;
Just like the increment operator, the decrement (--) operator can also be applied before and after the variable.
Both will result in the same decrement of 1.They both have distinct uses and can be diverged in the further types.
Pre-Decrement Operator
Post-Decrement Operator */
