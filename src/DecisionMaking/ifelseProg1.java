/*Decision Making in Java helps to write decision-driven statements and execute a particular set of code based
on certain conditions.The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of
statements and if the condition is false it won’t.

2)If-Else: If- else together represents the set of Conditional statements in Java that are executed according to the
condition which is true.
If-else is conditional statements that execute according to the correct statement executed.
If the if condition is true then the code block inside the if statement is executed else it executes the else statement block.

Syntax:
if (condition)
        {
        // Executes this block if
        // condition is true
        }
        else
        {
        // Executes this block if
        // condition is false
        }

/** Advantages of If else statement –
Conditional execution: The if-else statement allows code to be executed conditionally based on the result of a Boolean expression.
This provides a way to make decisions and control the flow of a program based on different inputs and conditions.

Readability: The if-else statement makes code more readable by clearly indicating when a particular block of code should be
executed.This makes it easier for others to understand and maintain the code.

Reusability: By using if-else statements, developers can write code that can be reused in different parts of the program.
This reduces the amount of code that needs to be written and maintained, making the development process more efficient.

Debugging: The if-else statement can help simplify the debugging process by making it easier to trace problems in the code.
By clearly indicating when a particular block of code should be executed, it becomes easier to determine why a particular piece
of code is not working as expected.

Flexibility: The if-else statement provides a flexible way to control the flow of a program. It allows developers to handle
different scenarios and respond dynamically to changes in the program’s inputs
