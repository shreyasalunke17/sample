/* 5.Logical Operators
These operators are used to perform “logical AND” and “logical OR” operations, i.e., a function similar to AND gate and
OR gate in digital electronics. One thing to keep in mind is the second condition is not evaluated if the first one is false,
i.e. it has a short-circuiting effect. Used extensively to test for several conditions for making a decision.
Java also has “Logical NOT”, which returns true when the condition is false and vice-versa

Conditional operators are:
&&, Logical AND: returns true when both conditions are true.
||, Logical OR: returns true if at least one condition is true.
!, Logical NOT: returns true when a condition is false and vice-versa */
