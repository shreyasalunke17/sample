/* 4.Relational Operators
These operators are used to check for relations like equality, greater than, and less than. They return boolean results after the comparison and are extensively used in looping statements as well as conditional if-else statements. The general format is,

Synatax: variable relation_operator value

Some of the relational operators are:
==, Equal to returns true if the left-hand side is equal to the right-hand side.
!=, Not Equal to returns true if the left-hand side is not equal to the right-hand side.
<, less than: returns true if the left-hand side is less than the right-hand side.
<=, less than or equal to returns true if the left-hand side is less than or equal to the right-hand side.
>, Greater than: returns true if the left-hand side is greater than the right-hand side.
>=, Greater than or equal to returns true if the left-hand side is greater than or equal to the right-hand side. */
