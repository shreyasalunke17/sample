/* 7.Bitwise Operators
These operators are used to perform the manipulation of individual bits of a number.
They can be used with any of the integer types. They are used when performing update and query
operations of the Binary indexed trees.

&, Bitwise AND operator: returns bit by bit AND of input values.
|, Bitwise OR operator: returns bit by bit OR of input values.
^, Bitwise XOR operator: returns bit-by-bit XOR of input values.
~, Bitwise Complement Operator: This is a unary operator which returns the oneâ€™s complement
representation of the input value, i.e.with all bits inverted. */
