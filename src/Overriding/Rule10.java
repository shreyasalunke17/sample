/*If super class and sub class have same methods including name,return type and parameters,
and if you try to call it using the object of the sub class.
Then the method in the sub class is invoked.
Constructor looks like method but it is not.It does not have a return type and its name is same as the class name.
But,a constructor cannot be overridden. If you try to write a super classâ€™s constructor in the sub class compiler
treats it as a method and expects a return type and generates a compile time error. */
