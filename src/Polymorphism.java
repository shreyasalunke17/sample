What is Polymorphism in Java?
Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming.
Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words,
polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations.
The word “poly” means many and “morphs” 74 means forms, So it means many forms.

Types of Java Polymorphism
In Java Polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:
1)Compile-time Polymorphism
2)Runtime Polymorphism

1)Compile-Time Polymorphism in Java
It is also known as static polymorphism.
This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.

*Method Overloading
When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded.
Functions can be overloaded by changes in the number of arguments or/and a change in the type of arguments.


2)Runtime Polymorphism in Java
It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch. It is a process in which a function call to the overridden
method is resolved at Runtime. This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding. Method overriding,
on the other hand, occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class.
That base function is said to be overridden.

Advantages of Polymorphism in Java
-------------------------------------
Increases code reusability by allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common class.
Improves readability and maintainability of code by reducing the amount of code that needs to be written and maintained.
Supports dynamic binding, enabling the correct method to be called at runtime, based on the actual class of the object.
Enables objects to be treated as a single type, making it easier to write generic code that can handle objects of different types.



Disadvantages of Polymorphism in Java
----------------------------------------
Can make it more difficult to understand the behavior of an object, especially if the code is complex.
This may lead to performance issues, as polymorphic behavior may require additional computations at runtime.
