/*
For-each is another array traversing technique like for loop, while loop, do-while loop introduced in Java5.
It starts with the keyword for like a normal for-loop.
Instead of declaring and initializing a loop counter variable, you declare a variable that is the same type as
the base type of the array, followed by a colon, which is then followed by the array name.
In the loop body, you can use the loop variable you created rather than using an indexed array element.
Itâ€™s commonly used to iterate over an array or a Collections class (eg,ArrayList)

It is mainly used to traverse the array or collection elements. The advantage of the for-each loop is that it
eliminates the possibility of bugs and makes the code more readable. It is known as the for-each loop because it
traverses each element one by one.


Syntax:
for(type var:array)
{
    statements using var;
}
